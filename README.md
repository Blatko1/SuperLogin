# Minecraft LoginPlugin

A simple Minecraft Plugin that keeps player accounts safe on cracked servers.

- Tested only on Minecraft version *1.16.4*.

This plugin was created for **personal use** to prevent hacking and cheating. It is **not recommended** to be used by others. **You have been warned.**

## How does this plugin work?

- Every time a new player enteres the server he will be teleported to a new *spawn* world where the player will have to register. After registering the player will be disconnected for a login.

- Every time an already registered player joins the server the player will be teleported to a already existing *spawn* world where he will have to login.

- After loging in the player will be teleported to a **temporary world** where he will have around 15 seconds to login or register.

- After a succesful login the player will be teleported back to world *world* (this part is **hardcoded**).
